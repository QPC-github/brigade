i(Bucket) Brigade is a command line application written in Go.  It uses the excellent [[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/goamz|GoAMZ]] library for S3 access.

It's got one goal: fast bucket<->bucket data sync.  Supports S3 and S3-like cloud storages (like Google Cloud Storage in interoperability mode, for example).
